  "title": "Are NFTs Safe, Legal, and Worth Anything?",
  "intro": "An NFT game is a video game that uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent in-game items, characters, or currencies players can truly own and trade. Each NFT exists on a blockchain, making ownership transparent and transferable. These \"play-to-earn\" games let players earn real-world value while developers create transparent, player-driven economies.",

    {
      "heading": "Are NFTs Secure?",
      "content": "NFTs are secure in principle but not risk-free. They provide immutable proof of ownership—once minted on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, ownership records are permanent. Their transparent ledgers allow anyone to verify authenticity, and cryptography protects transfers through private keys.\n\nHowever, risks exist. Smart contract flaws or scams can lead to stolen assets. Many NFTs rely on off-chain storage, meaning the linked image could disappear if servers fail. Fake marketplaces and phishing attacks are also common.\n\nTo stay safe: use hardware wallets, verify marketplaces, and buy from trusted creators. NFTs are secure at the blockchain level—but human errors, scams, or poor storage can compromise them."

    {
      "heading": "Are NFTs Worth Anything?",
      "content": "Yes—but value depends on demand, rarity, and utility. Some NFTs retain strong worth due to limited supply or brand recognition, while others fade once hype dies.\n\nNFTs gain value through utility (like game integration or event perks), scarcity, and creator reputation. Projects backed by legal clarity or reputable platforms also tend to hold value better. Conversely, oversupply, broken contracts, or unclear rights drag values down.\n\nIn short: NFTs can hold real worth when backed by purpose and credibility, but speculation alone makes them volatile."

    {
      "heading": "Are NFTs Illegal?",
      "content": "No—NFTs are legal in most countries. Laws target how they're used, not the technology itself. Legal issues arise when NFTs are sold as unregistered securities, use copyrighted material, or involve scams and fraud.\n\nTo stay compliant: verify usage rights, avoid \"profit guarantee\" projects, and use verified marketplaces. NFTs are legitimate digital assets, but misuse can lead to legal trouble."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Are People Still Buying NFTs?",
      "content": "Yes—but buyers are now more selective. The market has matured, shifting from hype to utility-focused projects in gaming, collectibles, and memberships.\n\nNFT trading volumes have stabilized, and average sale prices are rising as collectors focus on high-value assets. Buyers prioritize NFTs with real-world use or community value. Platforms like OpenSea continue to dominate trading activity.\n\nBottom line: NFTs are still selling, just with smarter demand—driven by function, not fad."
