  "title": "What Is Blockchain Technology?",
  "intro": "Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger system that records transactions securely across a network of computers without relying on a central authority. It ensures transparency, immutability, and trust by linking data blocks chronologically using cryptographic verification. This foundation powers cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps) that enable secure peer-to-peer exchanges across industries.",
  "sections": [
    {
      "heading": "What Is Blockchain Technology and How Does It Work?",
      "content": "Blockchain functions as a distributed ledger where transactions are bundled into blocks, validated by network participants, and added to a chain in chronological order. Validation uses consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) to confirm transactions and prevent double-spending. Once a block is confirmed, it becomes tamper-resistant because it contains a cryptographic link to the previous block.\n\nThis decentralized architecture eliminates single points of failure and makes data alteration computationally impractical. Major networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana rely on this model to secure digital currencies, NFTs, and dApps."

    {
      "heading": "How Does a Hash Help Secure Blockchain Technology?",
      "content": "A hash is a cryptographic function that transforms input data into a fixed-length string — a digital fingerprint. Each block contains its own hash plus the hash of the previous block, creating a linked chain. Altering any data changes the hash output, breaking the chain and alerting the network.\n\nHash functions like SHA-256 (used by Bitcoin) or Keccak-256 (used by Ethereum) make tampering computationally expensive. Combined with consensus rules, hashing ensures integrity and trust without central intermediaries."
    },
    {
      "heading": "What Is a Hash in Blockchain?",
      "content": "In blockchain, a hash is the cryptographic code that secures transactions and links blocks. It guarantees that even a tiny modification in transaction data produces a completely different hash, instantly revealing tampering attempts. Hashes make blockchain immutable and verifiable across distributed nodes, forming the backbone of secure ledger technology."

      "heading": "What Is Digital Currency?",
      "content": "Digital currency is money that exists only electronically and can be used for online transactions, transfers, or investments. It includes decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as centralized digital money such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Digital currencies enable faster, lower-cost, and borderless payments, often leveraging blockchain for security and transparency.\n\nStablecoins, which are pegged to assets like the US dollar, provide a way to reduce volatility and enable everyday use cases in digital ecosystems."

      "question": "What crypto is the next Bitcoin?",
      "answer": "No single asset guarantees to be \"the next Bitcoin.\" Ethereum, Solana, and other smart-contract platforms offer different features and use cases, but each carries distinct risks and adoption patterns."

    {
      "question": "What is the difference between crypto and Bitcoin?",
      "answer": "Bitcoin is a specific cryptocurrency — the first and most widely recognized. \"Crypto\" refers to the broader category of digital currencies and tokens built on blockchain technology."
