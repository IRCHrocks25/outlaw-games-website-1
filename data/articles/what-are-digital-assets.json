      "heading": "What Is Cryptocurrency: A Digital Asset?",
      "content": "Yes — cryptocurrency is a type of digital asset. It's a digital representation of value secured by cryptography and recorded on a blockchain. Under U.S. law, crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are explicitly treated as digital assets or property.\n\nThe IRS digital assets definition classifies cryptocurrencies as property that must be reported for tax purposes. Similarly, the proposed CLARITY Act of 2025 defines digital assets as \"any digital representation of value recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger.\"\n\nIn terms of regulation, some cryptocurrencies fall under SEC oversight if they meet the Howey Test, while others—like Bitcoin and Ether—are treated as commodities by the CFTC.\n\nUltimately, cryptocurrencies share the core traits of digital assets: they are transferable, verifiable, and not backed by any government. Their value depends on scarcity, adoption, and decentralized network consensus."

      "heading": "What Is a Virtual Currency?",
      "content": "A virtual currency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange or store of value but is not legal tender. It operates digitally without government issuance. According to the IRS Virtual Currency Guidelines (Notice 2014-21), virtual currencies like Bitcoin are treated as property for tax purposes.\n\nConvertible virtual currencies—such as Bitcoin and Ethereum—can be exchanged for fiat money, while non-convertible ones circulate only within games or platforms.\n\nCryptocurrency is a subset of virtual currency powered by decentralized ledgers. Meanwhile, digital assets form a broader category, encompassing cryptocurrencies, NFTs, stablecoins, and tokenized property."
