      "heading": "What Drives Crypto Prices?",
      "content": "Crypto prices are primarily driven by supply-and-demand dynamics but are also heavily influenced by liquidity, sentiment, macroeconomic trends, and regulation.\n\nSupply & Tokenomics: Fixed or deflationary supply models like Bitcoin's 21M cap and halving events reduce new issuance, increasing scarcity and price pressure.\n\nDemand & Adoption: Increased real-world utility—such as DeFi, NFTs, and payments—creates sustained demand beyond speculation.\n\nLiquidity & Market Structure: More exchange listings and trading volume lead to stability and efficient pricing.\n\nMacro Factors: Macro factors affecting crypto, including interest rates, inflation, and global liquidity, directly affect investor appetite for risk assets like crypto.\n\nRegulation: Supportive regulation (e.g., ETF approvals) strengthens investor confidence and institutional inflows."
