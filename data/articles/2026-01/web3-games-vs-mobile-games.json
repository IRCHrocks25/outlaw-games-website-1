  "title": "How Do Web3 Games Differ From Mobile Games?",
  "intro": "Web3 games differ from mobile games primarily in how ownership, rewards, and monetization are handled. While traditional mobile games focus on entertainment within closed platforms, Web3 games integrate blockchain technology to give players more control over assets, progression, and participation in digital economies. These differences change how players interact with games and how value is created over time.\n\nUnderstanding these distinctions helps players decide which type of game aligns with their goals, whether that’s casual play, competition, or long-term engagement.",

    {
      "heading": "How Is Ownership Different in Web3 Games?",
      "content": "Ownership is one of the most significant differences. In mobile games, in-game items, progress, and currencies are controlled entirely by the developer. Players can use them only within the game and lose access if the platform changes or shuts down.\n\nIn Web3 games, assets are often represented as on-chain tokens or digital items that players own directly. This ownership allows assets to be transferred, traded, or retained independently of the game itself, giving players more control and flexibility."
    },
    {
      "heading": "How Do Rewards Work Differently Between Web3 and Mobile Games?",
      "content": "Mobile games typically reward players with points, cosmetics, or progression that holds no value outside the game. These rewards are designed to increase engagement but cannot be exchanged or reused elsewhere.\n\nWeb3 games, on the other hand, may reward players with tokens or assets that have real utility. These rewards can sometimes be transferred, traded, or used across platforms, depending on the game design. This introduces economic considerations that are absent in traditional mobile games."
    },
    {
      "heading": "How Do Monetization Models Compare?",
      "content": "Mobile games rely heavily on ads, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. Players often pay for convenience, cosmetic upgrades, or faster progression. Monetization is usually one-directional, flowing from player to developer.\n\nWeb3 games use different monetization models, including transaction fees, marketplaces, and token-based utility. Revenue is often tied to player activity within the ecosystem, aligning developer incentives with ongoing engagement rather than forced spending."
    },
    {
      "heading": "What Role Does Transparency Play in Web3 Games?",
      "content": "Transparency is another key difference. Mobile games operate on centralized systems where rules, drop rates, and changes are controlled privately. Players often have limited visibility into how systems truly work.\n\nWeb3 games leverage transparent systems where transactions, rewards, and asset movements can be verified on public blockchains. This transparency helps build trust and allows players to better understand how games operate."
    },
    {
      "heading": "How Do Long-Term Incentives Differ for Players?",
      "content": "Mobile games are typically designed for short sessions and frequent monetization triggers. Progress is often reset or limited to encourage spending.\n\nWeb3 games often emphasize long-term incentives such as ownership, progression, and participation in evolving ecosystems. Players may remain engaged longer because their time investment can carry forward value beyond a single session or update."
